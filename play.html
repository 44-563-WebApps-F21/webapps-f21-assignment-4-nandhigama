                The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one
                else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of
                shame left.

               They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.

            <p class="speech">After a pause.] They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you
                cough?

           <p class="speech">They’re looking at us. What effrontery!

           <p class="speech"> They’re approaching. That’s very forward of them.
